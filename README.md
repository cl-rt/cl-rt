A personal GitHub repo that serves as a list of projects I've contributed to, with links and brief descriptions.

ADA-TS&A:
    - RTA-SDL-VAE | Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework for anomaly detection and reconstruction. Built for experimentation, visualization, and flexible data integration -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/RTA-SDL-VAE

D&A-IS&T:
- DS: 
    - DNA-PLOTLYTEMPLATE | PlotlyTemplate streamlines creating interactive, customizable Python visualizations for efficient data exploration -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/dna-plotlytemplate
    - DNA-LLMPROCESSDOC | A streamlined Python package for automated text extraction and processing, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to accurately process and categorize diverse document types -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/dna-llmprocessdoc
    - RT-PROJECTS-HACK-HSES | Automates the classification of documents as either 'Project Scope' or 'Non-Project Scope' using text extraction and a Large Language Model (LLM), also specifying the relevant project scope category, such as design, engineering, construction, commissioning, or demolition -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/rt-projects-hack-hses

- DE:
    - COMPUTER-VISION | Computer vision labelling and modelling patterns for Rio Tinto -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/computer-vision

PacOps-DS:
    - RTA-PACOPS-TRUEVIEW-SMART-ALERTS-AWS | Refactored and restructured the TrueView Smart Alerts codebase, replacing the original Accenture-developed implementation with an in-house solution and updated AWS infrastructure -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/RTA-PacOps-TrueView-Smart-Alerts-AWS
    - RT-DOZERPRODUCTIVITY | Applies DBSCAN clustering to dozer GPS data and uses alpha shape polygons to identify and analyze productive spatial zones, enabling performance insights from raw movement data through a configurable pipeline with preprocessing, parameter estimation, and hull computation -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/rt-dozerproductivity
    - RTA-PACOPS-KANGWINAN-SIM | Partitions downtime data and fits optimal failure-time distributions, approximated using GMMs to support simulation workflows for the Amrun expansion without exposing confidential data -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/rta-pacops-kangwinan-sim
    - RT-SQLENGINEER | Utility for fetching credentials from AWS Secrets Manager or .env files and configuring SQLAlchemy engines for MSSQL (with automatic ODBC driver detection) and PostgreSQL -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/rt-sqlengineer
    - RT-APP | Streamlit application skeleton designed to streamline the development of lightweight, production-ready data apps -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/rt-app

RTX: 
    - RTX-FTIRQAQC | Standardized QAQC workflow for FTIR data, based on John Carterâ€™s framework. Includes duplicate/replicate review; modelling coming soon -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/RTX-FTIR
    - RT-VAE | Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework for anomaly detection and reconstruction. Built for experimentation, visualization, and flexible data integration -> https://github.com/rio-tinto/rt-vae
